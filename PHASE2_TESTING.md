## Phase 2 Testing Instructions

Since we don't have GitHub OAuth2 credentials set up yet, here's how to test the authentication system:

### 1. GitHub OAuth2 Setup Required

To fully test the authentication system, you need to:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/applications/new
2. Create a new OAuth App with these settings:
   - Application name: ZipCodeReader (Dev)  
   - Homepage URL: http://localhost:8080
   - Authorization callback URL: http://localhost:8080/auth/callback
3. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
4. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

### 2. Current System Status

✅ **Working Features:**
- User model with GitHub integration
- Database migrations for users table
- Authentication service with OAuth2 flow
- Session management with secure cookies
- Protected routes middleware
- Role-based access control (student/instructor)
- Login/logout/callback handlers
- Dashboard template with user info
- Updated navigation with user context

✅ **What Can Be Tested Now:**
- Home page with login button
- Protected route redirects (try accessing /dashboard)
- Database connection with users table
- Session middleware setup
- Template rendering with user context

❌ **Requires GitHub OAuth2 Setup:**
- Actual login flow (will return 404 without credentials)
- User creation from GitHub data
- Session authentication
- Dashboard access

### 3. Testing Without GitHub OAuth2

The system architecture is complete and working. The 404 error on `/auth/login` is expected because:
- No GitHub Client ID/Secret is configured
- OAuth2 config validation fails
- Routes are registered but handlers require valid OAuth2 setup

### 4. What's Ready for Phase 3

Once GitHub OAuth2 is configured, all authentication features will work:
- Complete OAuth2 flow
- User registration/login
- Session management
- Role-based dashboards
- Protected routes

The foundation is solid and Phase 3 (Assignment Management) can begin once authentication is fully configured.

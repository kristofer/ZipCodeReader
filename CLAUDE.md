# ZipCodeReader Development Log

## Project Overview
Building a web-based reading list manager for ZipCode students and instructors using Go (Gin), SQLite3, and local authentication.

## Development Progress

### ✅ July 18, 2025 - Instructor Dashboard "Assign" Link Implemented & Template Issue Fixed

**Issue:** The "Assign" link in the instructor dashboard was not functional - clicking it showed a placeholder alert message. During implementation, a template name collision caused the instructor dashboard to display the wrong template content.

**Root Cause:** 
1. Missing route, handler, and template for assigning readings to individual students
2. Template name collision - both `instructor_assignments.html` and `student_assignment_management.html` defined the same `"instructor_content"` block, causing Gin's template loader to overwrite one with the other

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ **Added New Routes** - `GET /instructor/students/:username/assignments` and `POST /instructor/students/:username/assignments/:assignment_id/assign`
- ✅ **Created Handlers** - `ShowStudentAssignments` and `AssignToStudent` methods in `InstructorAssignmentHandlers`
- ✅ **Built Template** - `student_assignment_management.html` with comprehensive assignment management interface
- ✅ **Fixed Template Collision** - Changed student assignment template to use `"student_assignment_content"` block
- ✅ **Updated Base Template** - Added support for `"student_assignment_content"` template type
- ✅ **Updated Navigation** - Modified `assignToStudent()` JavaScript function to navigate to new page
- ✅ **AJAX Integration** - Assignment functionality uses AJAX with success/error messaging

**Features Added:**
- **Student Assignment Management Page** - Shows all instructor assignments with assignment status for specific student
- **Assignment Status Indicators** - Visual differentiation between "Already Assigned", "Completed", "In Progress", and "Not Assigned"
- **One-Click Assignment** - "Assign Reading" buttons for unassigned items
- **Student Information Display** - Username, email, role, and assignment statistics
- **Real-time Feedback** - Success/error messages with page refresh to update status
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly layout consistent with existing design system

**Technical Details:**
- **Routes:** 
  - `GET /instructor/students/:username/assignments` - Shows assignment management page
  - `POST /instructor/students/:username/assignments/:assignment_id/assign` - Assigns reading to student
- **Handlers:** 
  - `handlers.InstructorAssignmentHandlers.ShowStudentAssignments`
  - `handlers.InstructorAssignmentHandlers.AssignToStudent`
- **Template:** `templates/student_assignment_management.html` (uses `"student_assignment_content"` block)
- **Base Template:** Updated to handle `template_type: "student_assignment"`
- **Navigation Update:** Updated `assignToStudent()` function in `instructor_assignments.html`
- **Authentication:** Requires instructor role, validates assignment ownership and student role
- **Database Integration:** Uses existing `models.CreateStudentAssignment()` and related functions

**Template Issue Resolution:**
- **Problem:** Template name collision caused instructor dashboard to serve "Assign Readings to" page content
- **Fix:** Renamed template block in `student_assignment_management.html` from `"instructor_content"` to `"student_assignment_content"`
- **Base Template Update:** Added conditional for `{{else if eq .template_type "student_assignment"}}`
- **Handler Update:** Pass `"template_type": "student_assignment"` in template data
- **Result:** Instructor dashboard now correctly shows "Assignment Management" interface

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ **Route Registration** - Both local auth and OAuth2 sections updated in `main.go`
- ✅ **Page Accessibility** - Assignment management page loads successfully (HTTP 200)
- ✅ **Assignment API** - Successfully assigns readings and prevents duplicates
- ✅ **Status Display** - Shows correct assignment status (assigned/completed/in progress)
- ✅ **Student Integration** - Assigned readings appear in student's assignment list
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Proper validation for assignment ownership and duplicate prevention
- ✅ **Dashboard Fix** - Instructor dashboard correctly displays "Create Assignment" buttons and dashboard content
- ✅ **Live Testing** - Tested with 87 students and multiple assignments, successfully assigned fresh assignment to student1

**Files Modified:**
- `main.go` - Added routes in both auth sections
- `handlers/instructor_assignments.go` - Added `ShowStudentAssignments` and `AssignToStudent` methods
- `templates/student_assignment_management.html` - New template with unique `"student_assignment_content"` block
- `templates/base.html` - Added support for `"student_assignment_content"` template type  
- `templates/instructor_assignments.html` - Updated `assignToStudent()` function
- `test_instructor_assign_feature.sh` - Created test script for verification
- `test_complete_assign_feature.sh` - Comprehensive functionality test

**Data Status:**
- **Note:** Student1 has many assignments from extensive testing (shows "Already Assigned" for most assignments)
- **Fresh Assignments:** New assignments are correctly available for assignment and show "Assign Reading" buttons
- **Workflow Verified:** Complete assign workflow tested successfully - dashboard → assign link → student assignment page → assignment creation

**Ready for Production!** - Instructors can now click "Assign" next to any student to access a dedicated assignment management page and assign new readings with immediate feedback. Template rendering issue resolved.

### ✅ July 18, 2025 - Instructor Dashboard "View Progress" Link Fixed

**Issue:** The "View Progress" link in the instructor dashboard was not working - clicking it resulted in 404 errors.

**Root Cause:** Missing route and handler for `/instructor/students/:username/progress` endpoint.

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ **Added New Route** - `GET /instructor/students/:username/progress` in both GitHub and local auth sections
- ✅ **Created Handler** - `GetStudentProgress` method in `InstructorAssignmentHandlers`
- ✅ **Built Template** - `student_progress.html` with comprehensive student progress view
- ✅ **API Support** - Handler supports both JSON API responses and HTML page rendering
- ✅ **Progress Analytics** - Calculates completion rates, overdue assignments, and detailed statistics

**Features Added:**
- **Student Information Display** - Username, email, role
- **Progress Statistics** - Total, completed, in progress, assigned, and overdue assignments
- **Completion Rate** - Visual progress bar with percentage
- **Assignment Details Table** - Complete list with status, due dates, and direct links
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly layout with Tailwind CSS
- **API Compatibility** - JSON responses for programmatic access

**Technical Details:**
- **Route:** `GET /instructor/students/:username/progress`
- **Handler:** `handlers.InstructorAssignmentHandlers.GetStudentProgress`
- **Template:** `templates/student_progress.html`
- **Model Function:** Uses `models.GetStudentAssignmentsByStudent()` for data retrieval
- **Authentication:** Requires instructor role, validates student exists and has student role

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ **API Endpoint** - Returns proper JSON with student data and progress statistics
- ✅ **HTML Page** - Renders complete student progress overview
- ✅ **JavaScript Integration** - `viewStudentProgress()` function properly navigates to page
- ✅ **Progress Calculation** - Correctly calculates completion rates and overdue assignments
- ✅ **Data Display** - Shows 4 assignments for user 'kris' with proper status indicators

**Files Modified:**
- `main.go` - Added routes in both auth sections (lines 132 and 212)
- `handlers/instructor_assignments.go` - Added `GetStudentProgress` method
- `templates/student_progress.html` - New comprehensive progress template
- `test_view_progress.sh` - Created test script for verification
